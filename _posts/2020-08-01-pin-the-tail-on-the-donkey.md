A problem and a simple set of instructions to solve it. A good starting point for a game but also for coding.  
One of the two players is **blindfolded** and must pin a paper tail in the right place. He can do only few actions: go **up**, **down**, **left** or **right** and finally **pin** the tail.  
The other player can see the drawing and must help giving **instructions**.

### Let's compare with computers

A computer is **dumb** and can do a limited set of actions. You may think your computer or smartphone is very powerful but the core is still a poor *dumb* processor moving bits and making sums).

The only way to make a computer work is giving it instructions. So programmers must use the set of available actions and combine them in different ways thus making more complex actions.

### Playing the game

When kids play the game, they freely move the tail in front of the drawing and unknowingly add some extra *commands*, like **stop** or **go on**.  
These extra commands are actually a way to communicate to the blindfolded kid that an action must be **repated until** a certain **condition** is reached.

So we know the concept of **loop**. Let's make an example, but to make it undestandable we have to use a grid made of squares. It will also make it compatible with computers later.
