You probably know both words and probably use them interchangeably in your everyday life, but there's actually a **small but meaningful difference** that is better to keep in mind.

Let's start from some examples of data.
- 72 
- 69
- 76
- 76
- 79
- 33

We can confindently say that these are numbers, but **do you know what they mean?**
They could be ages of a group of people, they could be measurements of some objects, they could be some kind of temeperatures.

We lack a **key to understanding** the meaning of data. **Data is always raw** and cannot be used without the right **interpretation**.

**Information** on the other hand is **data** provided with a **reading key** that allows to know the right interpretation. Computers work with numbers so you can understand that it is essential to know their interpretation. 

### ASCII

As we have seen above there are several possible interpretations, but none of them is the one I used when writing them down.
I actually used **ASCII** table to pick the numbers. 

What is ASCII you say?  
It means **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**. Basically it is a *table* that maps numbers to letters and other symbols. If you check the numbers on the [table](https://www.ascii-code.com) you will see that those data above, if read through ASCII codification is actually a text message!

- 72 ⮕ H
- 69 ⮕ E 
- 76 ⮕ L
- 76 ⮕ L
- 79 ⮕ O
- 33 ⮕ !

Today software uses Unicode to represent text and numbers are actually saved as binary code on computers but that's a completely different story for another post.
