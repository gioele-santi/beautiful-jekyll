I am Gioele.
I am a developer and a teacher. 

I love music and play saxophone, electric bass, ocarina and EWI. I like cooking and I studied Japanese language.

I would like to write about my interests and share some knowledge. Even if future posts may seem unrelated one to another.

This post is called "Hello world!" because in computers and information technology the first piece of code you write is a simple program that greets the world and it seemed appropriate for a first post.

So thank you for reading, I hope you will enjoy this website!
