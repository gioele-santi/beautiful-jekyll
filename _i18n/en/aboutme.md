My name is Gioele. 
I am a programmer and teacher.

### Education and experience

I graduated with honors in **Computer Science** from University of Bologna. Both Bachelor's and Master's Degree.

While I was studying I did many jobs, especially in summer, I list some:
- assistant in a retirement home
- office work in an arcade video game import-export company
- computer technical assistance in University
- pollster
- employee in natural history museum

After graduating I worked as programmer in the field of **data security**, focusing on **MacOS** and **iOS** software design. But also working on small Android and Windows prototypes and **web** programming (PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap...).

Then I got into teaching and after two years of study, I am an authorized **maths and computer science teacher**.

### Hobbies

I like computers even in my free time, especially computer graphics. I studied and used **Blender** for a while (I stopped because I had no time with my job).

I like games. I am huge **Nintendo fan**. 

I also like game programming. While I was studying to become a teacher, I noticed the similarities between a good teaching project and a good game project and I started planning some small **educational games**, especially for children with learning disabilities. So I started learning **Godot engine** and joined some game jams.

I love music: rock, jazz, fusion. I play **saxophone**, **electric bass**, **EWI** and **ocarina**.

I can speak **Italian**, **English** and a little bit of **Japanese** (I got JLPT N3 in 2016).
